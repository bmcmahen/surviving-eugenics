Established by Nicola in 2007, Neighborhood Bridges has strived to be an active member of the Westmount, Oliver, and Queen Mary Park neighborhoods by focusing on activism, citizenship and community development.</p><p>The importance of taking oral histories and survivor testimonies from oppressed cultures, particularly those who are otherwise without voice, is very important to Nicola. She feels that this is the best way for these stories to be made known as it allows the testifiers the opportunity to own and direct distribution of their message. Nicola also believes that these stories can be used to create opportunities to bridge within and across cultures.</p><p>Nicola began her career in 1986 and since has tirelessly devoted her life to her work managing community supports, delivering provincial advocacy services, and organizational consulting. Despite all this, she still somehow finds time to be with her family and countless loved ones. Should there ever be a zombie apocalypse, Nicola Fairbrother would undoubtedly be the one who steps up to lead the resistance and ensure that humanity lives to see another day. Until then, she will continue to follow her dream of a world where everyone is a valued citizen. </p></div></div><div class="person"><a href="#" aria-describedby="tooltip" class="name popup">Robert A.

Abused by her mother, Muir was institutionalized at the Provincial Training School (PTS) in Red Deer at the age of 11. After two years of living at the PTS, Muir was given an intelligence quotient (IQ) test, where she scored below 70, and was diagnosed as a "moron". This test score contributed to the decision made by the Eugenics Board after a brief interview with Muir, and she was approved for sterilization, alongside numerous other PTS residents. At the time, she was lied to and told that she was having her appendix out. Subsequent IQ tests administered in her adulthood revealed that Muir actually has a normal IQ.</p><p>After leaving the Provincial Training School, Muir worked many positions, including as a babysitter. When she was unable to conceive a child in her first marriage, she found out she had been sterilized, and that the operation could not be reversed. Muir was also unable to adopt because of her time in an institution. In 1995, Muir launched a lawsuit against the Alberta government for wrongful sterilization. The case was very important, as it led to an apology on behalf of the Alberta government, and compensation being paid to hundreds of other wrongfully sterilized persons.</p><p>Muir's story was the topic of the documentary by the National Film Board of Canada, The Sterilization of Leilani Muir, and the Edmonton Fringe festival play, The Invisible Child. Muir continues to advocate for the rights of children, and to speak in public forums about her experiences. Her autobiography, A Whisper Past was released in 2014.</p></div></div><div class="person"><a href="#" aria-describedby="tooltip" class="name popup">Judy Lytton</a><div class="content"><p><strong>Judy Lytton</strong> (nee Faulkner) is a eugenics survivor and a current member of the Governing Board for the Living Archives on Eugenics in Western Canada.

Jonathan Faulds</a><div class="content"><p><strong>P. Jonathan Faulds</strong> is an Edmonton based lawyer who has specialized in defending clients whose civil and constitutional have been violated by the province of Alberta either because of their disability, ethnicity, or race. He represented Leilani Muir and many other sterilization survivors in court against the Province of Alberta. His practice now focuses strongly on aboriginal, constitutional, and class or mass actions. Faulds has been a frequent speaker on legal practice issues, and has a guest speaker on conferences dealing with aboriginal law issues.</p><p>Faulds was part of a national team of lawyers in Canada that represented clients who were former students in aboriginal residential schools. Although the original intention of residential schools was to teach English and Christianity to aboriginal children and adolescents, for the 150,000 who were forcibly removed from their homes and sent to the schools, many were physically and sexually abused until 1996 when the last school was closed (Jackson). This suit, which was settled in 2007, sought and achieved compensation and benefits totaling about $1.9 billion for about 80,000 former students which included 12,000 to 20,000 individuals who had suffered physical and/or sexual abuse in the schools (Cohen, 2006; Jackson, 2011). </p></div></div><div class="person"><a href="#" aria-describedby="tooltip" class="name popup">Sandra Anderson</a><div class="content"><p><strong>Sandra Anderson</strong> is an attorney in Alberta, and prior to her retirement, worked at the Field Law firm.

But her most notable cases have been those dealing with the “abrogation of fundamental human rights” (Eisler et al, 1997). One of the most public of such cases was that of her client, Leilani Muir, who successfully sued the province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized when Muir was a teenager, achieving for Muir $740,000 in damages for the pain and suffering Muir experienced from the effects of her forced sterilization (Eisler et al, 1997). </p><p>Anderson has also been very involved with education, and was presented with the 2012 Public Education Award from the Alberta Teacher's Association. She also serves on the board of the Canadian Mental Health Association, Edmonton Region.

The drugs used on these victims included the anabolic steroid norbolethone (now illegal in Canada) that was given to treat ‘undersized’ children, as well as the anti-psychotic tranquilizer haloperidol (Jimenez, 1998).
