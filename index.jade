          p <em>Surviving Eugenics</em> is a documentary about the history and ongoing significance of eugenics.  Anchored by survivor narratives from the province of Alberta in Canada, <em>Surviving Eugenics</em> provides a unique insiders' view of life in institutions for the "feeble-minded", and raises broader questions about disability, human variation, and contemporary social policies.

              .content
                p <strong>Nicola Fairbrother</strong> is the director of Neighborhood Bridges, an Edmonton-based human rights organization that is committed to ending the oppression of people with developmental disabilities. Established by Nicola in 2007, Neighborhood Bridges has strived to be an active member of the Westmount, Oliver, and Queen Mary Park neighborhoods by focusing on activism, citizenship and community development.
                p The importance of taking oral histories and survivor testimonies from oppressed cultures, particularly those who are otherwise without voice, is very important to Nicola. She feels that this is the best way for these stories to be made known as it allows the testifiers the opportunity to own and direct distribution of their message. Nicola also believes that these stories can be used to create opportunities to bridge within and across cultures.
                p Nicola began her career in 1986 and since has tirelessly devoted her life to her work managing community supports, delivering provincial advocacy services, and organizational consulting. Despite all this, she still somehow finds time to be with her family and countless loved ones. Should there ever be a zombie apocalypse, Nicola Fairbrother would undoubtedly be the one who steps up to lead the resistance and ensure that humanity lives to see another day. Until then, she will continue to follow her dream of a world where everyone is a valued citizen.

              .content
                p <strong>P. Jonathan Faulds</strong> is an Edmonton based lawyer who has specialized in defending clients whose civil and constitutional have been violated by the province of Alberta either because of their disability, ethnicity, or race. He represented Leilani Muir and many other sterilization survivors in court against the Province of Alberta. His practice now focuses strongly on aboriginal, constitutional, and class or mass actions. Faulds has been a frequent speaker on legal practice issues, and has a guest speaker on conferences dealing with aboriginal law issues.
                p Faulds was part of a national team of lawyers in Canada that represented clients who were former students in aboriginal residential schools. Although the original intention of residential schools was to teach English and Christianity to aboriginal children and adolescents, for the 150,000 who were forcibly removed from their homes and sent to the schools, many were physically and sexually abused until 1996 when the last school was closed (Jackson). This suit, which was settled in 2007, sought and achieved compensation and benefits totaling about $1.9 billion for about 80,000 former students which included 12,000 to 20,000 individuals who had suffered physical and/or sexual abuse in the schools (Cohen, 2006; Jackson, 2011).

                p <strong>Sandra Anderson</strong> is an attorney in Alberta, and prior to her retirement, worked at the Field Law firm. Anderson served as council for Leilani Muir and other sterilization victims. She has been a active speaker at educational venues on eugenics in Alberta. 
                p Anderson's primary areas of practice have been in labour, employment and privacy law (ATA). But her most notable cases have been those dealing with the “abrogation of fundamental human rights” (Eisler et al, 1997). One of the most public of such cases was that of her client, Leilani Muir, who successfully sued the province of Alberta for forcing her to be sterilized when Muir was a teenager, achieving for Muir $740,000 in damages for the pain and suffering Muir experienced from the effects of her forced sterilization (Eisler et al, 1997). 
                p Anderson has also been very involved with education, and was presented with the 2012 Public Education Award from the Alberta Teacher's Association. She also serves on the board of the Canadian Mental Health Association, Edmonton Region. Before becoming a lawyer, Anderson finished a Ph.D. in German Literature (ATA News, 2012).
                p Besides practicing law, Anderson has also been very active in speaking about the history and atrocities of eugenics in Alberta in various school and educational venues (Wahlsten, 2011).

                p <strong>Allan Garber</strong> LL.B. is a lawyer in Edmonton, Alberta that specializes in the rights of the elderly and hospital patients (Zabjek, 2011). In 1998, Garber represented 150 of the nearly 700 sterilization victims in a class action lawsuit against the province of Alberta for wrongful sterilization (Honore, 1998).
                p Some of Garber's clients had not only been sterilized by the province, but had also been used as subjects for experimental drug research without their knowledge or consent. The drugs used on these victims included the anabolic steroid norbolethone (now illegal in Canada) that was given to treat ‘undersized’ children, as well as the anti-psychotic tranquilizer haloperidol (Jimenez, 1998). In total, the class-action litigation against the province lasted three years and finally ended on November 2, 1999 with Justice Minister David Hancock announcing a settlement of $142 million as compensation to the victims (Lexpert, 2000).
